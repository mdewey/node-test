# Sample LHDI app

## What?

This is a sample node application to prove out LHDI. This might be transformed into either a BTSSS API or Med supply re-order

## TODO

- [x] linting
- [x] typescript
- [x] docker
- [x] env config
- [ ] ~swagger~ This is harder than it should, I have to list routes in two places or using some bonkers routes generator. This might cause me to pivot to a different framework
- [ ] logging
- [x] sample endpoint
- [x] git

## Things to prove out

- Talking to down stream service
- a QA and Prod env
- Datadog integration with vagov dd
- calling from va.gov website
- Cookie/`who is making this call` integration
